		"answer": "<h2><strong>Android Architecture</strong></h2><p>Android architecture contains different number of components to support any android device needs. Android software contains an open-source Linux Kernel having collection of number of C/C++ libraries which are exposed through an application framework services.</p><p>Among all the components Linux Kernel provides main functionality of operating system functions to smartphones and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) provide platform for running an android application.</p><p>The main components of android architecture are following:-</p><ul><li>Applications</li><li>Application Frameworks</li><li>Android Runtime</li><li>Platform Libraries</li><li>Linux Kernel</li></ul><p><strong>Applications:</strong></p><p>Application is the top layer of android architecture. The pre-installed applications like home, contacts, camera, gallery etc and third party applications downloaded from the play store like chat applications, games etc. will be installed on this layer only.</p><p>It runs within the Android run time with the help of the classes and services provided by the application framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Application Frameworks:</strong></p><p>Application Framework provides several important classes which are used to create an Android application. It provides a generic abstraction for hardware access and also helps in managing the user interface with application resources. Generally, it provides the services with the help of which we can create a particular class and make that class helpful for the Applications creation.</p><p>It includes different types of services <strong>activity manager, notification manager, view system, package manager</strong> etc. which are helpful for the development of our application according to the prerequisite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Android Runtime:</strong></p><p>Android Runtime environment is one of the most important part of Android. It contains components like core libraries and the Dalvik virtual machine(DVM). Mainly, it provides the base for the application framework and powers our application with the help of the core libraries.</p><p>Like Java Virtual Machine (JVM),&nbsp;<strong>Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)</strong>&nbsp;is a register-based virtual machine and specially designed and optimized for android to ensure that a device can run multiple instances efficiently. It depends on the layer Linux kernel for threading and low-level memory management. The core libraries enable us to implement android applications using the standard JAVA or Kotlin programming languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Platform Libraries:</strong></p><p>The Platform Libraries includes various C/C++ core libraries and Java based libraries such as Media, Graphics, Surface Manager, OpenGL etc. to provide a support for android development.</p><ul><li><strong>Media</strong>&nbsp;library provides support to play and record an audio and video formats.</li><li><strong>Surface manager</strong>&nbsp;responsible for managing access to the display subsystem.</li><li><strong>SGL</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>OpenGL</strong>&nbsp;both cross-language, cross-platform application program interface (API) are used for 2D and 3D computer graphics.</li><li><strong>SQLite</strong>&nbsp;provides database support and&nbsp;<strong>FreeType</strong>&nbsp;provides font support.</li><li><strong>Web-Kit</strong>&nbsp;This open source web browser engine provides all the functionality to display web content and to simplify page loading.</li><li><strong>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong>&nbsp;is security technology to establish an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Linux Kernel:</strong></p><p>Linux Kernel is the last layer of android architecture and also is&nbsp;heart of the android architecture. It manages all the available drivers such as display drivers, camera drivers, Bluetooth drivers, audio drivers, memory drivers, etc. which are required during the runtime.</p><p>The Linux Kernel will provide an abstraction layer between the device hardware and the other components of android architecture. It is responsible for management of memory, power, devices etc.</p><p>The features of Linux kernel are:</p><ul><li><strong>Security:</strong>&nbsp;The Linux kernel handles the security between the application and the system.</li><li><strong>Memory Management:</strong>&nbsp;It efficiently handles the memory management thereby providing the freedom to develop our apps.</li><li><strong>Process Management:</strong>&nbsp;It manages the process well, allocates resources to processes whenever they need them.</li><li><strong>Network Stack:</strong>&nbsp;It effectively handles the network communication.</li><li><strong>Driver Model:</strong>&nbsp;It ensures that the application works properly on the device and hardware manufacturers responsible for building their drivers into the Linux build.</li></ul>"

App developers building applications for this platform can get access to the core codes and are at a liberty to change the them to get the customized outcomes. This is not possible when it comes to iOS and app have to strictly adhere to the core code specifications when developing apps for the specific platform.</li></ul></li><li><h3><strong>Continual improvement &amp; removal of old features</strong></h3><ul><li>Google Android is supported by a huge community of developers and also users who continue to give feedback about the features, their pros and cons. As a result, there is continuous check on the codes and features, making modifications and alterations, bringing in better upgrades all the time. This is one of the reasons why Android is always adding new features while removing older ones that users do not like.</li></ul></li><li><h3><strong>Supports running multiple apps simultaneously</strong></h3><ul><li>With Android running on a device with good hardware specification, as a user you can have multiple apps running simultaneously. You can continue to listen to music as you check your messages or download files that you&rsquo;ve received or even upload them from your device or drive.</li></ul></li><li><h3><strong>Expandable memory &amp; runs on affordable large devices</strong></h3><ul><li>One of the biggest advantages of using devices running on Android platform is that it supports expandable memory. iOS devices on the other hand do not support external memory expansion by adding memory card to the phone. Users of this platform enjoy the privilege of storing e-books, music, videos and games on their devices.</li></ul></li><li><h3><strong>Affordable Development</strong></h3><ul><li>You can easily get your own app out in the android market and you don&rsquo;t need to pay big development fees. The application environments are free of charge and you can save a lot of money and there is no limit which means that if you want to make more than one app, you can do that without any problems.</li></ul></li><li><h3><strong>More</strong></h3><ul><li><h3><a href='http://www.credosystemz.com/training-in-chennai/best-android-training-in-chennai/' rel='noopener ugc nofollow' target='_blank'>Android&nbsp;</a>Is More Customizable Can change almost anything.</h3></li><li><h3>In Android, any new publication can be done easily and without any review process</h3></li><li><h3>Use a Different Messaging App for SMS</h3></li><li><h3>Android Offers an Open Platform</h3></li><li><h3>Easy access to the Android App Market</h3></li><li><h3>Cost Effective</h3></li><li><h3>Upcoming versions have a support to save RAW images</h3></li><li><h3>Built in Beta Testing and staged rollout</h3></li></ul></li></ul>"

		"referenceLink": "https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity",
		"answer": "<p><strong>An activity</strong> is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with&nbsp;<code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#setContentView(android.view.View)'>setContentView(View)</a></code>. While activities are often presented to the user as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating windows (via a theme with&nbsp;<code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowIsFloating'>R.attr.windowIsFloating</a></code>&nbsp;set),&nbsp;<a href='https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window'>Multi-Window mode</a>&nbsp;or embedded into other windows. There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:</p><ul><li><code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)'>onCreate(Bundle)</a></code>&nbsp;is where you initialize your activity. Most importantly, here you will usually call&nbsp;<code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#setContentView(int)'>setContentView(int)</a></code>&nbsp;with a layout resource defining your UI, and using&nbsp;<code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#findViewById(int)'>findViewById(int)</a></code>&nbsp;to retrieve the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with programmatically.</li><li><code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()'>onPause()</a></code>&nbsp;is where you deal with the user pausing active interaction with the activity. Any changes made by the user should at this point be committed (usually to the&nbsp;<code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider'>ContentProvider</a></code>&nbsp;holding the data). In this state the activity is still visible on screen.</li></ul><h3><strong>Activity Lifecycle</strong></h3><p>Activities in the system are managed as&nbsp;<a href='https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack'>activity stacks</a>. When a new activity is started, it is usually placed on the top of the current stack and becomes the running activity -- the previous activity always remains below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until the new activity exits. There can be one or multiple activity stacks visible on screen.</p><p>An activity has essentially four states:</p><ul><li>If an activity is in the foreground of the screen (at the highest position of the topmost stack), it is&nbsp;<strong><em>active</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>running</em></strong>. This is usually the activity that the user is currently interacting with.</li><li>If an activity has lost focus but is still presented to the user, it is&nbsp;<strong><em>visible</em></strong>. It is possible if a new non-full-sized or transparent activity has focus on top of your activity, another activity has higher position in multi-window mode, or the activity itself is not focusable in current windowing mode. Such activity is completely alive (it maintains all state and member information and remains attached to the window manager).</li><li>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity, it is&nbsp;<strong><em>stopped</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>hidden</em></strong>. It still retains all state and member information, however, it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden and it will often be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.</li><li>The system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its process, making it&nbsp;<strong><em>destroyed</em></strong>. When it is displayed again to the user, it must be completely restarted and restored to its previous state.</li></ul>"

They are as follows:</p><ol><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)'>onCreate()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Called when the activity is first created. This is where you should do all of your normal static set up: create views, bind data to lists, etc. This method also provides you with a Bundle containing the activity&#39;s previously frozen state, if there was one.</p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Always followed by&nbsp;<code>onStart()</code>.</p></li><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onStart()'>onStart()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Called when the activity is becoming visible to the user. Followed by&nbsp;<code>onResume()</code>&nbsp;if the activity comes to the foreground, or&nbsp;<code>onStop()</code>&nbsp;if it becomes hidden.</p></li><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onRestart()'>onRestart()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Called after your activity has been stopped, prior to it being started again. Always followed by&nbsp;<code>onStart()</code></p></li><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onResume()'>onResume()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Called when the activity will start interacting with the user. At this point your activity is at the top of its activity stack, with user input going to it. Always followed by&nbsp;<code>onPause()</code>.</p></li><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()'>onPause()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Called when the activity loses foreground state, is no longer focusable or before transition to stopped/hidden or destroyed state. The activity is still visible to user, so it&#39;s recommended to keep it visually active and continue updating the UI. Implementations of this method must be very quick because the next activity will not be resumed until this method returns. Followed by either&nbsp;<code>onResume()</code>&nbsp;if the activity returns back to the front, or&nbsp;<code>onStop()</code>&nbsp;if it becomes invisible to the user.</p></li><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onStop()'>onStop()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. This may happen either because a new activity is being started on top, an existing one is being brought in front of this one, or this one is being destroyed. This is typically used to stop animations and refreshing the UI, etc. Followed by either&nbsp;<code>onRestart()</code>&nbsp;if this activity is coming back to interact with the user, or&nbsp;<code>onDestroy()</code>&nbsp;if this activity is going away.</p></li><li><p><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onDestroy()'>onDestroy()</a></p><p style='margin-left:40px'>The final call you receive before your activity is destroyed. This can happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called&nbsp;<code><a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#finish()'>Activity#finish</a></code>&nbsp;on it), or because the system is temporarily destroying this instance of the activity to save space.

		"answer": "<p><strong>Services </strong>in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-android-development/'>Android</a>&nbsp;are a special component that facilitates an application to run in the background in order to perform long-running operation tasks. The prime aim of a service is to ensure that the application remains active in the background so that the user can operate multiple applications at the same time. A user-interface is not desirable for android services as it is designed to operate long-running processes without any user intervention. A service can run continuously in the background even if the application is closed or the user switches to another application.</p><p>There is a major difference between android services and threads, one must not be confused between the two. Thread is a feature provided by the Operating system to allow the user to perform operations in the background. While service is an&nbsp;<a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/components-android-application/'>android component</a>&nbsp;that performs a long-running operation about which the user might not be aware of as it does not have UI.</p><h4><strong>Types of Android Services:</strong></h4><ol><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Foreground Services:</strong></p><p>Services that notify the user about its ongoing operations are termed as Foreground Services. Users can interact with the service by the notifications provided about the ongoing task. Such as in downloading a file, the user can keep track of the progress in downloading and can also pause and resume the process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Background Services:</strong></p><p>Background services do not require any user intervention. These services do not notify the user about ongoing background tasks and users also cannot access them. The process like schedule syncing of data or storing of data fall under this service.</p></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Bound Services:</strong></p><p>This type of android service allows the components of the application like activity to bound themselves with it. Bound services perform their task as long as any application component is bound to it. More than one component is allowed to bind themselves with a service at a time. In order to bind an application component with a service&nbsp;<strong>bindService()</strong>&nbsp;method is used.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h4><strong>The Life Cycle of Android Services:</strong></h4><p>In android, services have 2 possible paths to complete its life cycle namely&nbsp;<strong>Started and Bounded</strong>.</p><h4>1. Started Service (Unbounded Service):</h4><p>By following this path, a service will initiate when an application component calls the&nbsp;<strong>startService()</strong>&nbsp;method. Once initiated, the service can run continuously in the background even if the component is destroyed which was responsible for the start of the service. Two option are available to stop the execution of service:</p><ul><li>By calling&nbsp;<strong>stopService()</strong>&nbsp;method,</li><li>The service can stop itself by using&nbsp;<strong>stopSelf()</strong>&nbsp;method.</li></ul><h4>2. Bounded Service:</h4><p>It can be treated as a server in a client-server interface. By following this path, android application components can send requests to the service and can fetch results. A service is termed as bounded when an application component binds itself with a service by calling&nbsp;<strong>bindService()</strong>&nbsp;method. To stop the execution of this service, all the components must unbind themselves from the service by using&nbsp;<strong>unbindService()&nbsp;</strong>method.</p><blockquote><p>To carry out a downloading task in the background, the&nbsp;<strong>startService()</strong>&nbsp;method will be called. Whereas to get information regarding the download progress and to pause or resume the process while the application is still in the background,&nbsp;<strong>the service must be bounded with a component</strong>&nbsp;which can perform these tasks.</p></blockquote><p>A user-defined service can be created through a normal class which is extending the&nbsp;<strong>class Service</strong>. Further, to carry out the operations of service on applications, there are certain callback methods which are needed to be&nbsp;<strong>overridden</strong>. The following are some of the important methods of Android Services:</p><ol><li>onStartCommand()<ul><li>The Android service calls this method when a component(eg: activity)&nbsp;requests to start a service using startService(). Once the service is started,it can be stopped explicitly using stopService() or stopSelf() methods.</li></ul></li><li>onBind()<ul><li>This method is mandatory to implement in android service and is invoked. Whenever an application component calls the bindService() method in order to bind itself with a service. User-interface is also provided to communicate, with the service effectively by returning an IBinder object.&nbsp;If the binding of service is not required then the method must return null.</li></ul></li><li>onUnbind()<ul><li><p>The Android system invokes this method when all the clients&nbsp;get disconnected from a particular service interface.</p></li></ul></li><li>onRebind()<ul><li><p>Once all clients are disconnected from the particular interface of service and there is a need to connect the service with new clients, the system calls this method.</p></li></ul></li><li>onCreate()<ul><li><p>Whenever a service is created either using onStartCommand() or onBind(), the android system calls this method. This method is necessary to perform&nbsp;a one-time-set-up.</p></li></ul></li><li>onDestroy()<ul><li><p>When a service is no longer in use, the system invokes this method&nbsp;just before the service destroys as a final clean up call. Services must&nbsp;implement this method in order to clean up resources like registered listeners,&nbsp;threads, receivers, etc.</p></li></ul></li></ol>"

The Content Resolver behaves exactly as its name implies: it accepts requests from clients, and&nbsp;<em>resolves</em>&nbsp;these requests by directing them to the content provider with a distinct authority. To do this, the Content Resolver stores a mapping from authorities to <strong>Content Providers</strong>. This design is important, as it allows a simple and secure means of accessing other applications&rsquo; Content Providers.</p><p>The Content Resolver includes the <strong>CRUD</strong> (create, read, update, delete) methods corresponding to the abstract methods (insert, query, update, delete) in the Content Provider class. The Content Resolver does not know the implementation of the Content Providers it is interacting with (nor does it need to know); each method is passed an URI that specifies the Content Provider to interact with.</p>"

		"answer": "<p><strong>Sticky Intent:</strong>&nbsp;These are the Intents which sticks with Android for future broadcast listener.</p><p>Sticky Intent is also a type of Intent which allows communication between a function and a service sendStickyBroadcast(), performs a sendBroadcast(Intent) known as sticky, the&nbsp;<strong>Intent you are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete, so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter)</strong>. In all other ways, this behaves the same as sendBroadcast(Intent).</p><p>One example of a sticky broadcast sent via the operating system is ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED. When you call registerReceiver() for that action &mdash; even with a null BroadcastReceiver &mdash; you get the Intent that was last Broadcast for that action. Hence, you can use this to find the state of the battery without necessarily registering for all future state changes in the battery.</p>"

		"referenceLink": "https://blog.mindorks.com/understanding-multidex-in-android",
		"answer": "<p>In Android, the compilers convert your source code into DEX files. This DEX file contains the compiled code used to run the app. But there is a limitation with the DEX file. The DEX file limits the total number of methods that can be referenced within a single DEX file to 64K i.e. 65,536 methods. So, you can&#39;t use more than 64K methods in a particular DEX file. These 64K methods include Android framework methods, library methods, and methods in our code also. This limit of 64K is referred to as the &quot;<strong>64K reference limit</strong>&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, if our app exceeds 65,536 methods, we will encounter a build error that indicates our app has reached the limit of the Android build architecture. The error is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><pre> <code>Too many field references: 131000; max is 65536. You may try using --multi-dex option.</code></pre></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Older versions of the build system report a different error, which also indicates the same problem:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><pre> <code>Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: method ID not in [0, 0xffff]: 65536</code></pre></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both the above error are known as&nbsp;<strong>64K reference limit&nbsp;</strong>i.e we are trying to use more than 64K methods in our code.
