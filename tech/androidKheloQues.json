	"referenceLink": "https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/launch-time#cold",
	"answer": "A cold start refers to an app’s starting from scratch: the system’s process has not, until this start, created the app’s process. Cold starts happen in cases such as your app’s being launched for the first time since the device booted, or since the system killed the app. This type of start presents the greatest challenge in terms of minimizing startup time, because the system and app have more work to do than in the other launch states.<br><br>At the beginning of a cold start, the system has three tasks. These tasks are:<br><br>1. Loading and launching the app.<br>2. Displaying a blank starting window for the app immediately after launch.<br>3. Create the app process.<br><br>As soon as the system creates the app process, the app process is responsible for the next stages:<br><br>1. Creating the app object.<br>2. Launching the main thread.<br>3. Creating the main activity.<br>4. Inflating views.<br>5. Laying out the screen.<br>6. Performing the initial draw."

	"answer": "<p>A warm start encompasses some subset of the operations that take place during a cold start; at the same time, it represents more overhead than a hot start. There are many potential states that could be considered warm starts. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>The user backs out of your app, but then re-launches it. The process may have continued to run, but the app must recreate the activity from scratch via a call to&nbsp;<code>onCreate()</code>.</p></li><li><p>The system evicts your app from memory, and then the user re-launches it. The process and the activity need to be restarted, but the task can benefit somewhat from the saved instance state bundle passed into&nbsp;<code>onCreate()</code>.</p></li></ul>"

	"answer": "A hot start of your application is much simpler and lower-overhead than a cold start. In a hot start, all the system does is bring your activity to the foreground. If all of your application’s activities are still resident in memory, then the app can avoid having to repeat object initialization, layout inflation, and rendering."

	"answer": "<p>Services in&nbsp;Android are a special component that facilitates an application to run in the background in order to perform long-running operation tasks. The prime aim of a service is to ensure that the application remains active in the background so that the user can operate multiple applications at the same time. A user-interface is not desirable for android services as it is designed to operate long-running processes without any user intervention. A service can run continuously in the background even if the application is closed or the user switches to another application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Types of <strong>Services:</strong></p><p>1. Foreground Services:&nbsp;Services that notify the user about its ongoing operations are termed as Foreground Services. Users can interact with the service by the notifications provided about the ongoing task. Such as in downloading a file, the user can keep track of the progress in downloading and can also pause and resume the process.</p><p>2. Background Services: Background services do not require any user intervention. These services do not notify the user about ongoing background tasks and users also cannot access them. The process like schedule syncing of data or storing of data fall under this service.</p><p>3. Bound Services:&nbsp;This type of android service allows the components of the application like activity to bound themselves with it. Bound services perform their task as long as any application component is bound to it. More than one component is allowed to bind themselves with a service at a time. In order to bind an application component with a service&nbsp;<strong>bindService()</strong>&nbsp;method is used.&nbsp;</p>"

	"answer": "<p>Broadcast in android is the system-wide events that can occur when the device starts, when a message is received on the device or when incoming calls are received, or when a device goes to airplane mode, etc. Broadcast Receivers are used to respond to these system-wide events. Broadcast Receivers allow us to register for the system and application events, and when that event happens, then the register receivers get notified. There are mainly two types of Broadcast Receivers: Static Broadcast Receivers: These types of Receivers are declared in the manifest file and works even if the app is closed. Dynamic Broadcast Receivers: These types of receivers work only if the app is active or minimized. Since from API Level 26, most of the broadcast can only be caught by the dynamic receiver</p>"

	"answer": "<p>The <strong>Content Resolver</strong> is the single, global instance in your application that provides access to your (and other applications&rsquo;) content providers. The Content Resolver behaves exactly as its name implies: it accepts requests from clients, and&nbsp;<em>resolves</em>&nbsp;these requests by directing them to the content provider with a distinct authority. To do this, the Content Resolver stores a mapping from authorities to <strong>Content Providers</strong>. This design is important, as it allows a simple and secure means of accessing other applications&rsquo; Content Providers.</p><p>The Content Resolver includes the <strong>CRUD</strong> (create, read, update, delete) methods corresponding to the abstract methods (insert, query, update, delete) in the Content Provider class. The Content Resolver does not know the implementation of the Content Providers it is interacting with (nor does it need to know); each method is passed an URI that specifies the Content Provider to interact with.</p>"

In all other ways, this behaves the same as sendBroadcast(Intent).</p><p>One example of a sticky broadcast sent via the operating system is ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED. When you call registerReceiver() for that action &mdash; even with a null BroadcastReceiver &mdash; you get the Intent that was last Broadcast for that action.

	"answer": "<p>In Android, the compilers convert your source code into DEX files. This DEX file contains the compiled code used to run the app. But there is a limitation with the DEX file. The DEX file limits the total number of methods that can be referenced within a single DEX file to 64K i.e. 65,536 methods. So, you can&#39;t use more than 64K methods in a particular DEX file. These 64K methods include Android framework methods, library methods, and methods in our code also. This limit of 64K is referred to as the &quot;<strong>64K reference limit</strong>&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, if our app exceeds 65,536 methods, we will encounter a build error that indicates our app has reached the limit of the Android build architecture. The error is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><pre> <code>Too many field references: 131000; max is 65536.
